## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails?
- Check Node version (should be 18+)
- Run `npm install` and `npm run build` locally first

### Routes Don't Work?
- Ensure `_redirects` file is in the `public` folder
- Check `netlify.toml` redirect rules

### Site Looks Broken?
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all assets are loading correctly
- Verify CSS is being applied

## Site URL

Your site will be available at:
- **Netlify subdomain:** `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
- **Custom domain:** (if configured)

## Continuous Deployment

With GitHub connection:
- Every push to `main` branch automatically deploys
- Pull request previews available
- Branch deploys for testing
